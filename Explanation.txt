Given a sorted positive integer array nums and an integer n, add/patch elements to the array such that any number 
in range [1, n] inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. 
Return the minimum number of patches required.

Input Description:
First line contains, m,n. (1<n<10000),(2<m<1000)
Second line contains, m sixe of integers as elements as array.

Output Description:
Print the minimum number of patches required.

Sample Input:
2 6
1 3

Sample Output:
1

Explanation:
Combinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.
Now if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].
Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].
So we only need 1 patch.
